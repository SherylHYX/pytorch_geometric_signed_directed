PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed Documentation
========================================

PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed is a signed/directed graph neural network extension library for `PyTorch Geometric <https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/>`_.  
It builds on open-source deep-learning and graph processing libraries. 
*PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed* consists of various signed and directed geometric deep learning, embedding, and clustering methods from a variety of published research papers and selected preprints. It is currently under development and we welcome your contribution!
