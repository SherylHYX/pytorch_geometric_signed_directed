*PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed* is a signed and directed extension library for [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric).

<p align="justify">The library aims to consist of various signed and directed geometric deep learning, embedding, and clustering methods from a variety of published research papers and selected preprints. It is currently under development and we welcome your contribution!
